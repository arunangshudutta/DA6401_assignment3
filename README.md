- Ques_1.ipynb: Basic code for RNN, LSTM, GRU network.
- Ques_2.ipynb: Contains the code vanilla seq2seq model wandb sweep for question number 2
- Ques_4.ipynb: Contains the code for making prediction/inference on the test data.
- Ques_5A.ipynb: Contains code for attention based model wandb sweep, and predictions/inference made on the test data using the attention based model.
- Ques_5B.ipynb: Contains code for predicion mismatch analysis for vanilla seq2seq model vs attention based model.

# Predicted dataset: 
- predictions_vanilla: folder containg the predictions made by the best vanilla seq2seq model.
- predictions_attention: folder containg the predictions made by the best attention based model.
